ssh-adverb
==========

ssh-adverb  is  almost  equivalent to ssh(1), but treats the command to
execute as a vector of strings in the manner of nice(1).

For example, the command:

    ssh remote echo '*'

will expand the asterisk on the server side and return a list of files.
In contrast:

    ssh-adverb remote echo '*'

will echo a single asterisk.


Installation
------------

If you got it from git:

    autoreconf -is

In any case:

    ./configure
    make check
    sudo make install

    man ssh-adverb
